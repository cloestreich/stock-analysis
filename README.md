Overview of Project
The overview of the project is to find out the yearly return for each stock in the spreadsheet for years 2017 and 2018.

Results
From the looks of it, 2017 was a very good year for the stocks in general (except for one). 2018 on the other hand, was not. 10 of the 12 stock had negative returns.  2 of the 12 stocks, however had very good years.

Summary
The advantages of refactoring code is that it can make things more efficient to the overall project.  The disadvantages are that things can get a little complicated for the code to all work in sync.

The advantage of original VBA script (green stocks) was that it made things simple to accomplish for a small project.  The disadvantage is that code like that only works for a small project of that scale.
